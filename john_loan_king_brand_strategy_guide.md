**Objection Handling – Scripts**

| Objection | Brand‑Aligned Response |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **“I’m only interested if you have the lowest rate.”** | “A great rate matters—but it’s just one piece of total cost. Let’s run the numbers side‑by‑side, including fees, tax impact, and future flexibility. If a lower‑rate loan elsewhere truly beats the full picture we create, I’ll tell you. My job is to save you money long‑term, not just win on a headline number.” |
| **“I’ve heard non‑QM loans are risky—aren’t they like the subprime stuff from 2005?”** | “Today’s non‑QM loans are built on stronger credit, larger down payments, and strict ability‑to‑repay rules—worlds apart from pre‑2008 subprime. They simply use common‑sense underwriting for entrepreneurs, investors, or foreign nationals conventional loans overlook. I’ll show you the exact safeguards so you can decide with confidence.” |
| **“A reverse mortgage sounds scary—I don’t want to lose my house.”** | “Ownership stays in your name, and you (or your heirs) always control whether the home is sold, refinanced, or kept. We’ll start by covering five reasons *not* to do a reverse mortgage. If it still looks right after that reality check, we’ll walk through the protections step‑by‑step.” |
| **“I don’t want to restart a 30‑year clock just to refinance.”** | “Totally fair. We can match or shorten your remaining term, or design a custom amortization schedule—so you keep momentum toward debt‑free. Let’s model a few scenarios and see which one best balances monthly cash flow and long‑term payoff.” |
| **“HELOCs take forever and the rate can spike.”** | “Traditional HELOCs, yes. Ours is a fixed‑rate line approved in a day and funded in 7–10 days—often appraisal‑free. Your payment stays predictable, and you can redraw principal as you repay. It’s built for speed *and* stability.” |
